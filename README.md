# PyTorch for Image segmentation
 This project implements several convolutional neural network models for semantic segmentation in PyTorch. It uses glomerulus identification as test subject to compare the performance of different neural networks, as well as loss functions.

## Models
 1. ResNet ([Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385))
 2. SE-ResNet ([Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01507))
 3. PSPNet ([Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01105))
 4. U-Net ([U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597))

## Loss functions
 1. binary cross-entropy loss
 2. Sørensen–Dice loss
 3. Jaccard loss
